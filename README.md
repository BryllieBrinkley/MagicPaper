MagicPaper is a prototype app I created that uses ARKit2 and livens up newspapers by playing video content relevant to the image that gets detected.
(Only works on the images and newspaper I used to create it for now, but I plan to incorporate functionality that will detect any image on any newspaper.)

Through developing this app, I gained and solidified knowledge in various learning topics, including...

* How to source assets
* Detecting Images in Augmented Reality
* Video playback in AR using SKVideoNode
* ARKit 2
* SceneKit

Installation & How to Run
To run this project, make sure you have Xcode on your machine and follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project file in Xcode and click the "play" button in the Xcode toolbar (or you can use the keyboard shortcut Command-R.)
The project should be built and run successfully (only on a physical device)

* NOTE: The images I took from my physical newspaper are located inside the 'Assets' folder. To view the functionality of this app,
you hover over those images displayed your computer screen while this app is running.

Enjoy! - Jibryll Brinkley
